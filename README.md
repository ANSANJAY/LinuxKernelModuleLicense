## Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of Linux Kernel Modules and their corresponding documentation, focusing on kernel taint, module licensing, and license access between different modules. The repository is organized into subdirectories, each illustrating a different aspect or example of Kernel Module development.

### 1_kernel_taint
- This directory focuses on the kernel taint mechanism. It contains a simple kernel module `hello.c`, a Makefile to compile the module, and `flags.md` detailing different taint flags. `kernel-chktaint` is a script/tool to check the taint status of the kernel, and `readme.md` provides comprehensive documentation about kernel taint, its causes, implications, and removal.

### 2_MODULE_LICENSE
- This directory contains an example illustrating the use of `MODULE_LICENSE`. It consists of a simple kernel module `hello.c`, a Makefile to compile it, and a `readme.md` explaining the significance of `MODULE_LICENSE`, its impact on the module, and kernel behavior.

### 3_module_accesing_different_license
- This directory contains examples of modules with different licenses accessing each other. It consists of two modules, `module1.c` and `module2.c`, with a GPL and Proprietary license, respectively. It also contains a Makefile for compilation and a `readme.md` detailing the expected behaviors, implications, and resolution strategies when modules with different licenses interact.

## Repository LICENSE
This repository is licensed under [Specify License Here]. Please refer to the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more details.

## General Instructions
- Ensure you have the necessary kernel headers and build tools installed to compile the modules.
- Navigate to the respective directories to build and load the kernel modules.
- Review the `readme.md` file in each subdirectory for specific instructions, explanations, and information related to each module.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the examples, documentation, or add new illustrations are welcome. Please follow the standard pull request process, and ensure any added examples or modifications are well-documented.

## Disclaimer
The examples in this repository are for educational purposes only. Please use caution and make sure to understand the code before loading any kernel module, as incorrect implementations can lead to system instability.

Feel free to modify the README according to any additional content, details, or structure changes made in the repository.
